# Contributing

I am not a Frontend developer. I just learned some basic NextJS in order to have the initial prototype. So the design and UX will go very slow. But not the content. So of course this is a 'Shout' for Frontend developers willing to contribute to Climate Change Awareness. Feel free to create a shiny PR (either for content or design).
