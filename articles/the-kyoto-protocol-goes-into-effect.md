The delayed [Kyoto Protocol](https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol#:~:text=The%20Kyoto%20Protocol%20was%20adopted,force%20on%2016%20February%202005.) on global warming finally came into effect today, seven years after it was first negotiated.
Environmentalists welcomed the development, which comes amid increasing fears about the effects global warming is already having. However, many voiced concern that the US and some other key countries had yet to ratify the protocol and that it does not go far enough.
Tony Blair, the prime minister, today said he was determined to pull the US "back into dialogue" over the need to tackle climate change.
He sought to reassure Washington that investment in science and technology meant reducing emissions did not have to affect living standards and economic growth and reaffirmed his commitment to making the issue a key priority during Britain's presidency of the G8 group of industrialised nations this year.
