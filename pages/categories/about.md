A **timeline** of the most significant [Climate Change](https://www.un.org/climatechange) events along the history to remember what we did and what we are doing raising awareness through the time.&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

**_Climateline_** collects events from different sources, curates the content and places them in time. The nature of events varies. Some might bring [negative effects](https://climate.nasa.gov/effects/) of global climate change: more frequent wildfires, longer periods of drought in some regions and an increase in the number, duration and intensity of tropical storms. Other events might bring [positive effects](https://drawdown.org/solutions): carbon removal from atmosphere, reforestation, renewable energy, energy efficiency and so on.  
**_Climateline_** aims also to summarize in numbers the progress of the society and backward actions in one place. This includes how (big) companies are doing in order to contribute positively. I see this place as a registry of all the evidence we need to know before asking _"Why is it so hot here?"_.
