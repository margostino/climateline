The establishment of the IPCC was endorsed by [UN General Assembly in 1988](https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2019/02/UNGA43-53.pdf). Its initial task, as outlined in UN General Assembly Resolution 43/53 of 6 December 1988, was to prepare a comprehensive review and recommendations with respect to the state of knowledge of the science of climate change; the social and economic impact of climate change, and potential response strategies and elements for inclusion in a possible future international convention on climate.
