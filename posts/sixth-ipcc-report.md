The [Sixth IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) warns that catastrophic outcomes cannot be ruled out.

Glasgow conference spurs pledges to restrict emissions — not enough to avoid dangerous climate change, but risk of catastrophic change is reduced.

Mean global temperature is 14.8°C, the warmest in tens of thousands of years. Level of CO2 in the atmosphere is 418 ppm, the highest in millions of years.

The United Nations’ climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published the third instalment of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) April 4, 2022. The report prepared by the IPCC Working Group III (WG-III) focuses on the mitigation of climate change, ie, the solutions necessary to halt global warming.

The full report collates the latest scientific research from across the world and extends to thousands of pages. But a condensed 63-page summary, titled the Summary for Policymakers (SPM) captures the key highlights.

Here are six takeaways from the SPM:
<br /><br />
1. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 54 per cent higher in 2019 than they were in 1990, but growth is slowing
2. Least developed countries emitted only 3.3 per cent of global emissions in 2019
3. Pledges to the Paris Agreement are insufficient, emissions must fall 43 per cent by 2030 compared to 2019
4. Abundant and affordable solutions exist across sectors including energy, buildings, and transport, as well as individual behavioural changes
5. The impact on GDP would be negligible and the long-term benefits of cutting emissions immediately would outweigh the initial costs
6. Finance falls short, especially in developing countries, but there is sufficient money in the world to close this gap
